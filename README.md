## by Atonye Eben-Foby


## Prosper Loan Dataset (2005-2014)

 > This is an exploratory analyis of loan data from Prosper MarketPlace, a peer to peer lending industry. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
 > For this  analysis the ProsperRating(alpha) that is only applicable to loans post July 2009 has been merged with the CreditGrade used for pre 2009 loans to form a new column called ProsperRating (New). All observations in the not employed income range category have been replaced with 0 dollars since there was already a $0 category in the dataset.


## Summary of Findings

> Most borrowers earn between $25,000 and $49,999 dollars. 
> The highest percentage(21%) of the dataset belongs to the C Prosper Rating category. 
> 98% of borrowers in the dataset are employed in some capacity, proving that most loans are given to people that have the capacity as at the time of loan application to pay back.  
> Very few low income earners ($1-24,999) fall into high prosper rating categories (AA, A and B).

> There was a steady decline in average estimated return from 2011-2014. 
> The 12 month termed loans typically do not exceed 10000 dollars. 
> The loan original amount is affected by the prosper rating as HR rated borrowers generally take out less loans than AA rated borrowers. 
>The lower  prosper rating categories have a higher estimated return than the higher prosper rating categories. 
> Homeowners have a lower APR than non home owners.
